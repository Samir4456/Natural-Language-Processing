# NLP Context Search Engine

This project is a simple **search engine web application** built using **word embeddings** trained on the Brown news corpus.  
It retrieves the **top 10 most similar contexts** for a given query using **dot product similarity**.

The application supports multiple embedding models:

This will:
- render perfectly on GitHub
- show the screenshot
- stay concise and clean (ideal for grading)

If you want, I can make it **even shorter (3–4 lines total)** or adapt it to your professor’s exact wording.
